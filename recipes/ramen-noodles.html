        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dr Rupy makes a quick chilli oil that makes all the difference to his speedy mushroom ramen.
            In December 2022, this recipe was costed at an average of £1.41 per portion when checking prices at four UK supermarkets. 
            The recipe is designed to be made in conjunction with a low-cost store-cupboard.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
            <li>6 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
            <li>1 tsp honey, agave syrup or caster sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the chilli oil, stir all of the ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>To make the ramen, boil the eggs in a small saucepan of simmering water for 7–8 minutes. 
                Remove and plunge into a bowl of cold water for a few minutes before peeling, halving and setting the eggs aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan and fry the onion and mushrooms for 6–7 minutes. 
                Add the ginger, garlic, pepper and soy sauce and stir for 30 seconds. 
                Crumble in the stock cubes, pour in 1.5 litres/2¾ pints water and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare the noodles according to the packet instructions (if using rice noodles that take 8 minutes to cook, add them to the saucepan now).</li>
            <li>Add the carrots, peas and cooked noodles to the pan. Simmer for another 3 minutes until the vegetables have slightly softened. 
                Serve the ramen in six deep bowls, topped with 2 egg halves and drizzled with the chilli oil.</li>
        </ol>
